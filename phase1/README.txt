Hello Morteza!

Here are some assumptions that we made:

1. username are unique
2. everyone using this program will not be stealing from their trading partner - they will show up to the return meeting
3. assuming that trades wont be left open indefinitely - accounts.users either cancel, confirm or they report that the other party didn't show up
4. For testing purposes, you can edit the thresh holds found in AccountManager (admin can also edit these)
5. We have not fully implemented user input error handling. For now, we assume accounts.users do not input any invalid inputs.

There are no accounts.users initialized so you will need to sign up first! However, we do have 1 admin created. Here are the credentials:
username: Tina
password: 123456

(I know! Very safe!)


Stay safe and Happy Grading!!!:)
