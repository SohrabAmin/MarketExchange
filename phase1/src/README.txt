Hello Morteza!

Here are some assumptions that we made:

1. username are unique
2. everyone using this program will not be stealing from their trading partner - they will show up to the return meeting
3. assuming that trades wont open indefinitely - they cancel
4. For testing purposes, you can edit the thresh holds found in AccountManager (admin can also edit these)

There are no users initialized so you will need to sign up first! However, we do have 1 admin created. Here are the credentials:
username: Tina
password: 123456

(I know! Very safe!)

Happy Grading!!!:)
