Hello Morteza nad Professor Shorser,

Hope you are doing well and staying safe.


Assumptions we have made:
The only assumption we make is that users will never abandon the system in the middle of a trade.
They will always enter whether they showed up to the meeting or did not or if they got stood up.

There is also limitations for how much money each person can input into the system.


For your ease, we have created test users and test items in the system already for you.Keep in mind that logging in is
case sensitive.
Below are the credentials:
Super admin: Username: Tina Password: 123456

Users:
Username: Tina - Password: 123 - items they own: Shoe, ebook, sock, book
Username: Mo - Password: 123 - items they own: pen
Username: A -  Password: 123 - items they own: phone
